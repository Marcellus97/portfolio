    <h1>
        about me
    </h1>

    <p>
        i'm a software engineer based in cincinnati, ohio. i am most experienced with java and spring web and batch
        applications. i enjoy solving difficult problems, and have curious personality.
        in my free time, i love cooking, recently playing chess (<a href="https://www.chess.com/member/marcellus97">play
        me!</a>), rocket league, and learning languages (Spanish, Chinese,
        Dutch, Arabic).
        there is nothing more fun to me than 'grinding' a skill. i find the slow but steady progression after consistent
        effort quite
        addictive.
    </p>
    <p>
        being hungry for learning is something i make an effort to cultivate in my free time, as well as my career.
        i try stay up to date in the software engineering field by reading books and blogs on new and old topics.
        one of my most recent favorite books is "effective java" by joshua bloch.
